Staking on Casper
=======

A feature of Proof of Stake protocols is that token holders are able to actively participate in the protocol 
through a mechanism known as ‘staking’. 

Persons that hold their own private keys can choose to stake their tokens with any validator in the Casper network. 
Alternatively, it is possible to stake token via an exchange or custody provider as well.

This guide will outline the steps required to stake the CSPR token on the Casper network.
