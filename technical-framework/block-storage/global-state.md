# Global State

Blockchain can be viewed as decentralized, distributed database with verifiable computation layer on top. In order to do anything meaningful we need a way to store data \(in blockchain context these may be contracts, accounts etc\). From a Computer Engineering perspective Global State \(as we call this distributed, decentralized database\) can be thought of as key-value store, a mapping between byte-arrays and byte-arrays.
