Bonding
=======

Unlike other networks, Casper requires that a bonding request be sent prior to beginning the synchronization process. 
The node needs to be recognized as a bonded node prior to the era in which the bonding request clears the auction and takes effect.  
In the Charlie testnet, era durations are approx. 30 minutes. To send a bonding request, itâ€™s necessary to build the add-bid contract locally. 

Visit [Github](https://github.com/CasperLabs/casper-node) and fork and clone the repository.
Follow the instructions to build the contracts.
