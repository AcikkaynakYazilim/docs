Reward
^^^^^^
Validators receive rewards for participating in consensus by voting on blocks sending finality signatures (finalizing blocks). There is no precise per-block reward. Rewards are split proportionally among stakes within an era. If a validator is offline or cannot vote on many blocks, the rewards earned are also reduced. Delegators can only receive a proportional amount of the validator's rewards minus the validatorâ€™s commission (Delegation Rate). Rewards are distributed at the end of each era.

Runtime
^^^^^^^
The Casper runtime layer encompasses deployment and execution of `smart contracts <S.html#smart-contracts>`_, `session code <S.html#session-code>`_, and other activity that performs computation on the `global state <G.html#global-state>`_. 

Rust
^^^^
A programming language similar to C++, designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency.

Rustdocs
^^^^^^^^
As part of the Rust development environment, the Rustdocs describe the the `Casper contracts library <https://docs.rs/casperlabs-contract/>`_, the `Casper types library <https://docs.rs/casperlabs-types/>`_, and the `Casper test support library <https://docs.rs/casperlabs-engine-test-support/>`_.
