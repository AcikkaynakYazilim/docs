Reward
^^^^^^
Validators receive rewards for participating in consensus and finalizing blocks. There is no precise per-block reward. Rewards are split proportionally among stakes within an era. If a validator is offline or cannot vote on many blocks, the rewards earned are also reduced. Delegators can only receive a proportional amount of the validator's rewards minus the validatorâ€™s commission (Delegation Rate). Rewards are distributed at the end of each era.

Root hash
^^^^^^^^^
The root node of the hash tree (or `Merkle tree <M.html#merkle-tree>`_) of all the transactions in a block.

Rust
^^^^
A programming language similar to C++, designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency.

Rustdocs
^^^^^^^^
As part of the Rust development environment, the Rustdocs describe the the `Casper contracts library <https://docs.rs/casper-contract/>`_, the `Casper types library <https://docs.rs/casper-types/>`_, and the `Casper test support library <https://docs.rs/casper-engine-test-support/>`_.
