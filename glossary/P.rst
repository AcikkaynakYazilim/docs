Participate in consensus
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The process of following the `consensus <C.html#consensus>`_ algorithm. The primary participants are `validators <V.html#validators>`_.

Peer node
^^^^^^^^^
A node on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.

Primary token
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Casper platform defines only one token which one can pay for transaction execution. Presently this is called `CSPR <C.html#cspr>`_.

Proof of stake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Proof of stake (PoS) is a type of consensus mechanism by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network achieves distributed consensus. The voting power is proportional to the amount of tokens (digital currency specific to this system). A popular choice in such systems is then to periodically delegate a fixed size committee of participants which then is responsible for running the consensus on which blocks to add to the blockchain.

Proof of work
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A mechanism using in Bitcoin and Etherium for incentivizing participation and securing the system. In these protocols, the voting power of a participant is proportional to the amount of computational power possessed.
