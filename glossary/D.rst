dApp
^^^^
A distributed application (dApp) is a set of `smart contracts <S.html#smart_contract>`_.

Deploy
^^^^^^
An **external client to node** message that includes two transactions:

#. **payment transaction** - executed to buy gas for the execution of main **transaction**
#. **main transaction** - the actual piece of software that does the actual processing changing the global state

The **external client** sends a deploy hoping that the network will execute the main transaction against the blockchain.

Devnet
^^^^^^
A version of the network that can be used for development. Users can run nodes and connect to a public bootstrap node, validators/node operators can spin up nodes, and developers can deploy and execute smart contracts.

Directed acyclic graph
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A directed acyclic graph is a directed graph that has no cycles. A vertex *v* of a directed graph is said to be reachable from another vertex *u* when there exists a path that starts at *u* and ends at *v*. 

In the Highway protocol, validators exchange messages in order to reach consensus on proposed blocks and hence validate one of many branches of the produced blockchain. As a way of capturing and spreading the different validatorsâ€™ knowledge about the already existing messages, it adopts the DAG framework, in which every message broadcast by a validator refers to a certain set of messages sent by validators before.
