# A Brief History of \(Block\) Time

## 1st Generation: a Distributed Ledger

With release of the first Bitcoin whitepaper by Nakamoto in 2008, the first Byzantine Fault Tolerant \(BFT\) distributed ledger saw the light of day. Nakamoto described and subsequently successfully launched a network protocol that enables the storage of transactions in a perpetual, immutable way. The network is secured through a consensus methodology called "Proof-of-Work", whereby network nodes compete for periodic rewards by solving math problems requiring hard "work", namely computation power. The first network node to solve one such period math problem, gets to append a "block" of transactions to the chain of previous blocks and is rewarded with an amount of currency. \[IMPROVE/EXPAND DESCRIPTION\]. We have since come to refer to such a network protocol as a "Blockchain".

## 2nd Generation: a Turing-Complete Distributed Computer

Since the launch of Bitcoin, the Blockchain concept has been iterated upon by many derivative and alternative projects. The most notable innovation was accomplished with the launch of Ethereum in 2015 \(first described by Vitalik Buterin in 2014\), with a stated goal of launching an unstoppable, turing-complete global computer \[FIND QUOTE / REFERENCE\], rather than a distributed transaction ledger. Its aim was to maintain an immutable, unstoppable global state through BFT consensus. Similar to Bitcoin, it adopted a Proof-of-Work consensus model and launched its Ethereum Virtual Machine, allowing developers to launch "distributed Apps" \(dApps\), or software applications that run on numerous machines distributed globally, and not controlled by any centralized entity.  
  
While rightfully credited for heralding in the age of the dApp, certain shortcoming have been universally recognized in this 2nd Generation of Blockchain:

1. **Inefficient Consensus Method**: Just like Bitcoin before it, Ethereum has adopted Proof-of-Work as its consensus method, which is wasteful both from an energy consumption perspective, as well as from a computational efficiency perspective \(rather than leveraging the majority of the computational power in the global network for running dApps, it is used to solve Proof-of-Work related math problems\).
2. **Insufficient Throughput**: While an improvement over 1st Generation Bitcoin, which can only process 5-10 transactions per second, the Ethereum network can effectively process between 10-20 events per second. This is not sufficient to support global decentralized computation needs.
3. **Serial Computation**: The Ethereum Virtual Machine is single threaded, meaning it runs one process at the time, in sequence. New processes have to line up in queue before being run.
4. **One Size Fits All Approach**: regardless of the use case, geography and other economical considerations, the network fees to execute a transaction or to run a dApp follow globally uniform pricing across the network. In fact, all other aspects of the network \(\[INSERT EXAMPLES OF VARIABLES THAT CAN BE CONFIGURED ON SHARD BASIS IN OUR NETWORK\]\) are globally uniform too for all dApps that run on the network, without regard for their underlying needs.
5. **Proprietary Programming Language**: rather than allowing developers to program their dApps using open, well-known and widely used and understood programming languages, the Ethereum Virtual Machine mandates the use of a proprietary language called "Solidity" that up until the launch of Ethereum, had no user base, no community and no mindshare with established software developers, significantly hampering its broad adoption in the wider software development world as a whole.

## 3rd Generation: Age of the Compromises

Many projects have tried to address one or several of above 5 shortcoming in recent years. Within the Ethereum community itself, multiple proposals exist to retrofit solutions onto the network to address some of the above. In the context of Ethereum, replacing fundemental components of the network several years into its existence appears to be akin to replacing an engine on an airplane mid-flight. Technically the risks are extremely large and difficult to understate, while crypto-economically the changes appear at least equally prohibitive. For example, Ethereum is planning on replacing its inefficient Proof-of-Work consensus method with Proof-of-Stake, yet its network is run by miners who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in specialized hardware optimized for Proof-of-Work. The conflicting economical forces in this equation are blatantly obvious. As an initial compromise, Ethereum is proposing to have a hybrid network initially, whereby some blocks are brought to consensus via Proof-of-Stake, while maintaining the majority of blocks with Proof-of-Work consensus.

Other projects have also attempted to tackle one or multiple of the above 5 shortcoming in order to inch closer to a blockchain protocol that is suitable for mainstream adoption. These attempts by other projects usually tackled only _some but not all_ of the 5 shortcomings, or did so by _introducing new shortcomings_. Specifically, many projects that attempted to address the Insufficient Throughput problem, did so by compromising on decentralization:

6. **Lack of Decentralization**: In order to control network conditions and/or governance of the network, projects have opted to maintain pseudo-centralized control of the network, or delegated control to a limited number of actors that are not always fully independent of each other, or the protocol developers, or whose position of being a "main node" of the network was acquired as a result of a paid auction process. 

While some 3rd generation projects such as EOS and \[FILL IN EXAMPLES\] have exceeded prior milestones in achieving new levels of adoption by compromising on decentralization, such compromise is antithetical to the founding principles of Blockchains and distributed computing. 

Similarly, other 3rd generation projects have adopted open programming languages, introduced alternative consensus methods or allowed concurrent execution of smart contracts \[FOOTNOTE TO EXAMPLE PROJECTS\], but always while compromising on one or several of the other shortcomings. As such, the age of 3rd generation of Blockchain projects can be seen as a period of daring development efforts and imaginative innovation that ultimately fell short of delivering on its promise: an uncompromised, decentralized computation platform that's ready for mainstream adoption.

## 4th Generation: Going Mainstream

In 2019, CasperLabs introduces the first 4th generation blockchain platform that exhibits **all** qualities required for mainstream adoption. Specifically, as outlined in the detailed sections of this white paper, all 6 shortcomings found in 1st, 2nd and 3rd generation blockchains outlined above, are absent in CasperLabs' blockchain technology:

1. **Consensus Method**: CasperLabs is the first to implement the Correct-by-Construction Casper Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol as described [here](https://github.com/cbc-casper/cbc-casper-paper) by Vlad Zamfir, Researcher for the Ethereum Foundation and Head of Research for CasperLabs.
2. **Throughput**: By implementing a consensus protocol that reserves its computation capacity for actual computational work rather than PoW math problems, and through other network on protocol design decisions, CasperLabs' blockchain achieves throughputs of thousands of events per second, rather than tens.
3. **Concurrent Execution**: CasperLabs' execution engine is multi-threaded and allows for multiple dApps \(Smart Contracts\) to be executed concurrently. On the consensus protocol level, multiple validators are also allowed to propose blocks concurrently. 
4. **Sharding**: CasperLabs enables customization and free-market innovation through sharding, whereby shards can exist in the network with entirely unique parameters and configuration. For example, the fee model for a shard may be unique to its published specialization \(e.g. a "storage shard"\), or a shard may provide ultra-low-latency and fast block finality for specialized dApps such as distributed exchanges.
5. **Open to All Programming Languages**: Rather than introducing a new, proprietary and obscure programming language for the development of dApps, CasperLabs' execution engine is based on WebAssembly, or WASM, the open standard put forward by the W3C. WASM is a binary instruction format that is designed as a target for compilation of high-level languages like C, C++, Rust and many others. In fact, community projects to develop compilation targets for WASM in almost _all_ high-level languages are underway or encouraged. This open approach allows any software engineer to start developing on CasperLabs' blockchain immediately.
6. **Fully Decentralized**: CasperLabs believes in full decentralization on all levels, specifically: \(1\) _the operation of the blockchain network shall be open to anyone_. No master-nodes shall be sold, in fact master-nodes don't exist in the network. No special roles shall be delegated. Equal opportunity shall exist for all that wish to operate network nodes. \(2\) _development of the software shall be open source and community driven_. While CasperLabs is excited to take a leading role in the development of the blockchain software initially, it expects the community to take over the lead after the initial launch of the network and encourages community participation in the software development at all times. \(3\) _governance of the network shall be community driven_. CasperLabs believes that decentralized networks should be governed by their community of stakeholders, and not by centralized entities or disproportionally by one category of stakeholders. Governance principles will be put forth to ensure this. 

With the introduction of the first 4th generation blockchain as laid out in the subsequent chapters of this white paper, CasperLabs believes the road to full mainstream adoption is wide open.
