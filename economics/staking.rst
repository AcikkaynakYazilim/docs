Staking and Delegation
----------------------

Bonding Auctions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the present blockchain model relies on universal validation of blocks
included in the consensus history, there is a sharp tradeoff between intuitive
notions of decentralization/security and performance. Choosing the correct
balance requires setting proper incentives, or even hard rules, for validator entry,
in a manner that ensures performance remains acceptable without exposing
the platform to oligopolistic capture.

An open auction with open bids, a simple, first-"price" resolution and a
fixed number of slots solves the issue with imprecise control over the
security/performance tradeoff, while offering prospective validators
an easy to understand procedure for joining.

Delegation
~~~~~~~~~~

Users are able to delegate their own CLX to validators
without having to become validators themselves. Validators, in turn, take a
commission out of the rewards and transaction fees earned through delegated CLX.
Further, delegated tokens can be used in bidding for validator slots.
