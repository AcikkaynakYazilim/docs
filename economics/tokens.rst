Tokens
------

The CasperLabs blockchain hosts its own native token, having the symbol CLX,
that serves many functions for the networkâ€™s participants. Similar to Ethereum,
users use CLX to fund their transactions, and validators receive rewards in CLX.
Additionally, CLX is used as deposit when becoming a validator, as part of the
Proof of Stake protocol. New CLX is minted through seigniorage to incentivize
validators, whereas bonded CLX is slashed occasionally to punish faults.

Users are able to delegate their own CLX to validators
without having to become validators themselves. Validators, in turn, take a
commission out of the rewards and transaction fees earned through delegated CLX.
Further, delegated tokens can be used in bidding for validator slots.
