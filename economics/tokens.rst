Tokens
------

The CasperLabs blockchain hosts its own native token, designated by the symbol CLX,
which serves many functions for the networkâ€™s participants. It is used
as deposit when becoming a validator, as part of the
Proof of Stake protocol. Similar to Ethereum,
users use CLX to fund their transactions, and validators receive rewards in CLX.
New CLX is minted through seigniorage to incentivize
validators, whereas bonded CLX is burned to punish faults.
