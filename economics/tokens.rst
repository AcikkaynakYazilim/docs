Tokens
------

The CasperLabs blockchain hosts its own native token, having the symbol CLX,
that serves many functions for the networkâ€™s participants. Similar to Ethereum,
users use CLX to fund their transactions, and validators receive rewards in CLX.
Additionally, CLX is used as deposit when becoming a validator, as part of the
Proof of Stake protocol. New CLX is minted through seigniorage to incentivize
validators, whereas bonded CLX can be burned to punish faults.
