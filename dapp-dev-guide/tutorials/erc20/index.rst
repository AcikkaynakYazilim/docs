===============================

Most of smart contract developers are famillar with ERC-20 standard. It comes from the Ethereum ecosystem and it's a well established standard for building new smart-contract-based tokens. In this tutorial we will implement it for the CasperLabs platform. 

The final code is available in `GitHub <https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/erc20>`_. If you haven't read `Writing Rust Contracts on CasperLabs <../writing-rust-contracts.html>`_ , we recommend you start there.
