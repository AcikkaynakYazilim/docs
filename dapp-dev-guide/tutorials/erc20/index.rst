ERC-20 Tutorial
===============

This tutorial reviews an implementation of the ERC-20 standard for Casper.

Most smart-contract developers are familiar with ERC-20 standard, which comes from the Ethereum ecosystem. This standard is well established for building new tokens based on smart contracts. In this tutorial, we will implement the ERC-20 standard for the Casper blockchain. 

The code for this tutorial is available in `GitHub <https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/erc20>`_. If you haven't read `Writing Rust Contracts on Casper <https://docs.casperlabs.io/en/latest/dapp-dev-guide/writing-contracts/writing-rust-contracts.html>`_ , we recommend you start there.
