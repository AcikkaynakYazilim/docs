This flowchart outlines the process we will go through in this tutorial. Since there are quite a few things taking place, you should keep in mind the overall flow as you proceed through the tutorial on your own, so you do not get lost in the minutia of the details.

To summarize the flowchart above, this tutorial will walk you through deploying a contract unto the blockchain and then calling two separate contract entry points to increment a counter variable. Along the way, you will learn how to query the network state to see when the network has successfully incremented the counter.
