## Getting Help 

CasperLabs makes available the following resources for you to connect and get support where you can:

* Connect live with members of our Engineering Team on our `Discord Channel <https://discordapp.com/invite/mpZ9AYD>`_ available to support you with the progress of your projects.
* Join the `CasperLabs Community Forum <https://forums.casperlabs.io/>`_ that includes Technical discussions on using the CasperLabs features, obtain support, and pose questions to the CasperLabs core development team.
* Subscribe to CasperLabs Official `Telegram channel <https://t.me/CasperLabs>`_ for general information and update notifications about our platform.


If you have issues and bugs related to CasperLabs maintained smart contracts, you can `file an issue on our main GitHub repository <https://github.com/CasperLabs/CasperLabs/issues/new>`_, or `whichever repository the issue is related to <https://github.com/CasperLabs>`_.

Otherwise, if you...

* have questions that are not issues,
* need technical support,
* want to give feedback, or suggestions for improvement,
* or participate in a bounty,

you can use our `Jira Service Desk <https://casperlabs.atlassian.net/servicedesk>`_.
