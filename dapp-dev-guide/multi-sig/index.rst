Multi-Signature Tutorial
========================

This tutorial covers an example of key management. You will set up a smart contract, a client that will invoke the contract, and a local test network to test key management end-to-end. As a result, you will learn to:

* Use the multi-signature (multi-sig) feature on the Casper network
* Create a smart contract and sign transactions with multiple keys

You will explore `various permissions <../../implementation/accounts.html#permissions-model>`_ and sign transactions with multiple signatures. 

The final code is available in GitHub under `Casper Keys Manager <https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/keys-manager>`_.
